## Introduction

Every successful project begins with a clear roadmap. In this blog, letâ€™s dive into how
we created our Functional Specification Document, which defines the requirements,
features and expected behaviour of the software.

## What is a Functional Specification Document?

A Functional Specification Document is a detailed guide that describes, what a
system should do, how it should behave in certain different scenarios, user
interactions as well as the corresponding expected outcomes. It is the bridge
between the idea and its technical implementation. So, everyone working on a
project are of the same understanding.

## Functional Specification Document Structure:
We structured our Functional Specification Document into the following sections.
Introduction, General Description, Functional Requirements, System Architecture,
High Level Design and Preliminary Schedule.

Introduction and General Description focused on providing a high-level summary of
the project. The Functional Requirements are the core functionalities the system
must support. The System Architecture section aims to bring understanding to the
system parts (Frontend, Backend, Database) and how the should interact with each
other. High Level Design shows visually how a user progresses through the system.
The preliminary Schedule, is a schedule that highlights the order in which tasks and
phases are dependent on each other.

## Final Thoughts

A well defined Functional Specification Document is the foundation of any software
project. We hope it will help us to stay on track, and ensure our project meets user needs
efficiently.
