## Introduction

After developing the core functionalities of our project, we conducted a user testing phase to
help us evaluate its usability, accuracy and effectiveness. The goal was for us to gather real
user insights and to identify any areas for improvement. A structured evaluation
methodology based on practices in user interface testing and user-centred design. This
methodology was designed to ensure that our design would meet user needs. This blog will
focus on our thought process throughout and how we conducted the testing.

## Methodology

Our approach made use of direct and indirect observation methods to assess the usability of
the UI. We made use of the think-aloud protocol, asking users to verbalize their thoughts
while interacting with the UI. This helped us to understand their thought process and uncover
any usability issues, Testing was done in person or remotely on Zoom. This setup enables some indirect
observation. Remotely we could record both the user and their screens, so we could capture
user behavior without interfering with their experience.

Our evaluation metrics were a mix of quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess usability.
Based on metrics like a task success rate, error rate and a post-test questionnaire.

Our questionnaire aligned with common practices, focusing on close-ended questions with
some open ended questions for added depth and allowing users to elaborate on their
experiences.

Some questions include, the initial thoughts on the application, if any bugs or technical
issues were encountered, how easy users found the application to use, user thoughts on the
accuracy of the pronunciation feedback, would the user trust this tool to improve their
pronunciation overtime, how intuitive was the interface and the likelihood of recommending
the product to others.

## Conclusion

User testing provides valuable insight into how people interact with a product. These insights
will identify areas to improve. These improvements will guide a project into its next
development phase, ensuring a better experience for users.
