## Introduction

This will be the last blog post, focusing on our reflection of our journey as well as future
improvements. As we wrap up the development and testing phase of our pronunciation tool,
we are very excited about the possibilities ahead. This project has been both a challenging
and rewarding experience, we have learned an awful lot along the way. Here's a look at
what's next, as well as some reflections on the fun we had during development.

## Possible Improvements and Features
Although our project is fully functional and provides our users with feedback, both of us still
believe that there is plenty of room for improvement and growth. Based on our user testing
and internal deliberation.
Currently the project only provides basic feedback on pronunciation accuracy. A possible
upgrade would be the addition of Artificial Intelligence to deepen the feedback offered to the
user. Detailed phonetic breakdowns along with possible improvements are all possible with
AI.

Pronunciation practice can get repetitive, users cannot be expected to spend hours on our
site as it is. To keep the interest of users, elements like Streaks and Achievements, Daily Challenges, Leaderboard
system and pronunciation games would help with this.
To help with progress tracking, we could include functions to allow users to set goals.
Analysis of user history to provide personalized learning paths, to help users in areas they
are more lacking in.

The project could be expanded to include multi-language support, increasing the value of the
software by orders of magnitude. Making it useful for global language learners.

## Challenges and Lessons

Developing this project has been a great experience. Along the way we have faced
challenges, and learned new skills. Our understanding of APIs and request handling
improved by leaps and bounds.

The challenge of implementing wav2vec and pronunciation scoring was difficult yet
fascinating. Our knowledge of machine learning models improved just by implementing them.
The project allowed us to learn tools like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It taught us about
website designing, and our research in designing websites elevated our knowledge.

Most importantly was working as a team. Sharing ideas and collaborating made the process
smoother and enjoyable. The saying teamwork makes the dream work was fully realized by
us during the project. Working together allowed us to increase our efficiency.

Some fun moments of the project were trying to record ourselves saying sentences wrong
and listening back. Succeeding in fixing a bug that took days to figure out. Lastly working
together, was very enjoyable.

## Final Thoughts

Building our project has been an incredible experience. We started with an idea, transformed
it into a working application, we faced challenges, but we also had so much fun, and we are
proud of what we've created. Thank you for Listening!
