Before moving on with the backend. We decided to work on getting the model to work. As this is the main componenet of our project it was crucial we were able to make it run and perform the pronunciation feedback.

Luckily the documentation on how to load the model was not too difficult. Most of the time was spent on comparing the learner's attempt to the native pronunciation.

The comparison process evaluates the learner's pronunciation by breaking both the native transcript and learner transcript into individual words and aligning them. If the words are identical, they receive a 100% similarity score. Otherwise, we use SequenceMatcher to measure how closely the learnerâ€™s word matches the native pronunciation, returning a similarity score between 0% and 100%.

This method allows us detect partial correctness instead of strict corectness which would not provide much feedback to the user no how well their attempt was.
