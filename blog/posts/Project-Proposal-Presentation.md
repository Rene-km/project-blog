Today we presented our project proposal and had it approved. We were nervous coming into the presentation so we are delighted about this. However, we were given a few critiques, namely:

- UI is not clearly defined. 
- Need to think of how the app should behave when a mispronunciation is detected.

These are two areas we need to focus on as they determine how well the app will function and how intuitive it will be for users. There are quite a few questions we need to answer on the user experience, e.g. should a user be able to retry multiple times?, should we calculate accuracy based on the phrase or individual words. These are questions we need to address moving forward to make our project as effective and user-friendly as possible.
