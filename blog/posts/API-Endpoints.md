## Creating the API Endpoints

Today we worked on creating serializers to convert the Django models into JSON responses for the API.
Using the APIView model for API development, we built endpoints for, user registration, login
and logout.

POST and GET views for updating and viewing user progress, getting all questions users could
practice. There were also endpoints for uploading Audio from the answer, in base64 format.

Lastly there was an endpoint for getting an answer, as well as the details about the
mispronunciations of the user, it worked by transcribing the audio to text and then comparing
that to the native transcript making use of wav2vec. It then returns the word-by-word
pronunciation accuracy.

We had issues in implementing ffmpeg, as on some systems it was missing preventing audio processing. The issue was with saving ffmpeg as a Path. We were able to resolve this issue by including the execution files within the project. And manually telling the system the exact path to ffmpeg.exe and ffprobe.exe. Furthermore the path had to be placed in the settings.py file as if ffmpeg was called before the path was rerouted, we would experience errors. Placing the path within the settings.py file made sure it was executed before it was called on anywhere else in the project.

We tested our APIs using Postman and Djangoâ€™s built-in browser.

## Conclusion

Now that we have built the core backend API for our system, we will be focusing on the
frontend integration.
