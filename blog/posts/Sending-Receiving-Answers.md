With the recording set up, all that was left was to send the audio to the backend and recive the feedback. We again decided to use the TanStack library. To send the user's answer we used the useMutation hook. This hook helps in tracking state of api calls that create or update data. 

We ran into an issue when the audio was being sent into the backend and specifically with the audio format. It worked on my system which runs on Linux but not on Michael's which is a Windows system. On windows it did not recognise the audio format that was being sent.

To fix this we had to ensure the audio being sent was formatted correctly. It seemed as if the audio being generated by the Media Recorder api was not formatted correctly. So we had to take an audio buffer and maually set the headers before sending the request. 

## Displaying feedback

We again used the useQuery hook to track the state of the feedback request. Whenever the data is available it gets displayed. Each word is givev a similarity score out of 100.
