## Login and Register API

With the api implemented we could finaly start making some calls on the frontend. We decided to start with the login and register requests as we have made those components.

For the form schema, we used zod. This is a type-safe validation library. Fetch API was then used for the POST requests. On a successful request, the router sends the user to the appropriate route.
