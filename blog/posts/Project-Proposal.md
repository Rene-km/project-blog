We met with Ellen Rushe to discuss our poject idea. As her research centres around deep learning with limited labels, with a focus on audio and visual data, we thought she would be a good supervisor for us.

During our meeting she was interested in our idea and prvided insight into which models can be used to implement the project. The following is a brief overview of our proposal.

## How The Project Works
Users will be able to record their voice, and our application will:

1. Record their voice and have it transcribed.
2. Analyze pronunciation accuracy and provide feedback.
3. Allow users to track their progress over time.

## Tech Stack

Our tech stack is not too complex. It includes technology we are familiar and have not used before.

- Next.js (TypeScript) – For an intuitive and responsive web interface.
- Django (Python) – Handling data processing, authentication, and API requests.
- PyTorch & Wav2Vec – Using pre-trained speech recognition models to transcribe and analyze user pronunciation.

## Division of Work

To develop the application me and Michael plan to develop the application as follows:

**Rene**

- Building the user interface using Next.js.
- Sending user audio from the frontend to the backend.
- Implementing authentication (login, registration, profile management).
- Creating a progress-tracking dashboard for users.

**Michael**

- Building the backend using Django.
- Receiving and processing audio from users.
- Integrating PyTorch models for speech-to-text transcription.
- Sending feedback data back to the frontend.

## Final Thoughts

The both of us are looking forward to working on this project. It is an exiting and ambitious project that combines web development, speech recognition and AI. We are looking forward to the challenges, learning experiences, and innovations that will come from developing this application.
