Today we just continued on from yesterday. We met up again at the Ultimate Coffee cafe (They have great wifi) to look into the UI.

Our first objection before hopping into code, was to outline the user flow and design wireframes on paper. Our key components would be the Home page, Register &amp; Login pages, lesson and question pages.

For the lesson page we were inspired by the lesson layout of Leetcodes website. We
decided on displaying the questions in their difficulty groups for added user experience. We
paid extreme attention to how we display the feedback from the user, which was one of the
concerns broached to us during our proposal. We decided to display each word of user
answers in a colour corresponding to its correctness. This would make it very easy for the
user to see what words are being mispronounced and how close they are to being correct.

We also decided to change our website theme from white and blue to black an white. Lastly, we decided on a logo for the website.
