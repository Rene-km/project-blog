Michael and I met up to discuss possible project ideas. We wanted to work on something that is both meaningful and technically challenging.  

We explored various ideas, ranging from AI-driven applications to tools that could assist in everyday tasks. In the end, we settled on developing a platform focused on helping people with their pronunciation.  

We believe this project idea meets our criteria as it:  

## 1. Has Real-World Use Cases  
- This is a website that fulfills a genuine public need.  

## 2. Is a Technological Challenge  
- This project allows us to integrate **speech recognition, audio processing, and machine learning**.  
- It will push us to understand concepts in **AI and software engineering**.  

## 3. Offers an Opportunity for Skill Expansion  
- Both Michael and I have experience with web development, but this project challenges us to work with **audio processing** and potentially other areas in which we lack experience.  

We are excited to start building and documenting our progress along the way! ðŸš€
