Michael and I took the machine learning module over the past two weeks, and as a result, we haven't made much progress. Today, we met up to discuss the frontend and, most notably, the tools we will use.

As previously mentioned, we have opted to use Next.js. We looked more in depth at some of its features and how they can help us solve our problems. It offers similarity with React, which we have experience with. Next.js is easier to code and requires less code, with internal routing features that make it very API friendly. 

It automates many of the build processes and offers built-in support for server-side rendering.
Together with tailwind it provides a component-based structure for reusable UI elements
allowing for the development of an aesthetically pleasing website.

We also discussed the theme, components, and structure of the website. Since neither of us have much experience in UI/UX design, we wanted to choose tools that would simplify the process while still allowing flexibility in customization.

We decided to use a component library called Shadcn. This will help give all our components a uniform feel. These components will be customized with Tailwind CSS to suit our needs.

We also looked at other options, such as Bootstrap, Bulma, and DaisyUI, but ultimately, Shadcn felt like the best fit for our project due to its flexibility and seamless integration with Next.js.

Since neither of us have a great deal of experience when it comes to web design and CSS, we plan to spend the next few days getting to grips with CSS and Tailwind.
